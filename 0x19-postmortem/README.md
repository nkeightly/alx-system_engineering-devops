# Outage Postmortem
# Issue Summary
Duration: February 1st, 2023, 9:00 AM to 9:15 AM (UTC)
Impact: During this time, the company's e-commerce website was down for 15 minutes, affecting 100% of users trying to access the site. Customers were unable to make purchases and were faced with an error page.
Root Cause: A misconfigured firewall rule caused incoming traffic to the website to be blocked.

# Timeline
9:00 AM: Issue detected - A customer complained about not being able to access the website
9:05 AM: Investigation started - The operations team was alerted and started to investigate the issue
9:10 AM: Misleading investigation - The team initially assumed the issue was with the website's server and started debugging that, but it was not the root cause
9:12 AM: Escalation - The team escalated the issue to the security team after realizing it was a firewall issue
9:15 AM: Resolution - The firewall rule was corrected, and the website was back online
Root cause and resolution
The root cause of the issue was a firewall rule that was misconfigured. The firewall was blocking incoming traffic to the website, causing the site to be inaccessible. The issue was resolved by correcting the firewall rule and allowing incoming traffic.

# Corrective and preventative measures
Regularly review and update firewall rules to prevent misconfigurations in the future
Implement monitoring for incoming traffic to the website to quickly detect any similar issues in the future
# Bonus: A Little Bit of Humor to Lighten the Mood
We understand that outages can be a real pain, especially for our customers. But we want to assure you that the team is always working hard to prevent them from happening. Just think of it as a fire drill for the website, you know, in case of a real fire (or rather, a real outage). And if you're still feeling down about it, just remember, at least the website's not on fire!
